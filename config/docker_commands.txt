# https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-remove-docker-images-containers-volumes-and-networks/

# Having bookmarked this immensely useful tip a while ago, the two-liner above :) can be now done in one line:

#  To remove ALL containers:
# docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)

# And similar for all images:
# docker rmi $(docker images -q)

# REMOVE ALL, for images use above one
# docker system prune --volumes

# WARNING! This will remove:          TO START FROM SCRATH!
# - all stopped containers
# - all networks not used by at least one container
# - all volumes not used by at least one container
# - all dangling images
# - all build cache
# Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y

# To stop all running containers use the docker container stop command followed by a list of all containers IDs.
# docker container stop $(docker container ls -aq)


Have you changed the passwords since you first tried running the containers? 
docker-compose does extra work to preserve volumes between runs (thus preserving the database); 
you may want to try 
docker-compose rm -v
to delete everything and try starting it up again.
